# Resume Builder

A Docker container with LaTeX and XeLaTeX set up for compiling my resumes. This speeds up the process on my Kubernetes cluster by pre-installing dependencies.

## What's in it

- XeLaTeX with font packages (texlive-xetex, fonts-recommended, fonts-extra)
- Python 3 with OCI CLI for uploading to Oracle cloud storage
- Git and other basic tools
